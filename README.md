These files should be replaced in the zed_open_capture file before the building and installation process so that the library can be used and seen by every main project. The Findxxx.cmake files are in the cmake folder. Replace them in the corresponding folder of the zed_open_capture lib.

after replacing all files you should continue with the normal build and installation and use as a template the CMakeLists.txt file present in the folder called Yourproject
